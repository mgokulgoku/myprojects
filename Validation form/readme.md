# Contact Form with Validation

Contact form that checks if user input is correct before submitting.

#What it does?
- Validates name (letters only)
- Checks email format
- Ensures phone number is 10 digits
- Shows error messages
- Changes field colors (red/green)

#Built with
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Google Fonts (Poppins)

#How to use?
Open form.html, fill out the form. It will show errors if something's wrong, success message when submitted correctly.

#What I learned?
- JavaScript form validation
- Regular expressions (regex)
- DOM manipulation and event listeners
- CSS styling for different states

The regex part was confusing but I figured it out eventually.

#Files
- form.html - main page
- form.css - styling
- form.js - validation logic

#Future ideas
- Add more field types
- Better error messages
- Form data storage

Good practice with JavaScript validation!
