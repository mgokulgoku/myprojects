# Todo List App

Simple todo list to track daily tasks.

# What it does?
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete (gets crossed out)
- Delete tasks when done
- Shows completion counter

# Built with
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Google Fonts (Poppins)

# How to use?
Open todoList.html, type a task, click "Add". Click on tasks to mark complete, use delete button to remove.

# What I learned?
- JavaScript arrays and DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- CSS flexbox for layout
- Updating the page dynamically

The hardest part was making everything update properly when items changed.

# Files
- todoList.html - main page
- style.css - styling
- script.js - JavaScript logic

# Future ideas
- Save tasks so they don't disappear
- Edit existing tasks
- Add due dates

Basic but functional. Good practice with JavaScript!
